  - outputFile - This is the file / name that creates upon Shop Generation.  (BTW keep the `.js` because as of right now  since this app cant make other file types)
```JS
outputPath: "./Shop-output",
outputFile: "catalog_config.json" // Dont  Don't change it if you using  backends like: Reload, LawinV2, Momentum
```

## Backend Compatibility (Any OGFN backend)

The rotator now supports output profiles so you can generate files for different backend styles without editing code.

Important: This tool does not hook to any backend. It only creates output files that you manually copy/replace in your backend shop files.

### Output profiles

- `simple` (default):
  - Keys like `daily1`, `featured1`
  - Each slot has `itemGrants` + `price`
  - Works for most config-based backends.

- `simple-meta`:
  - Same as `simple`
  - Also includes `displayAssetPath`, `NewDisplayAssetPath`, and `meta.SectionId`
  - Useful for backends that expect display assets or section metadata.

- `catalog`:
  - Generates a full `/fortnite/api/storefront/v2/catalog` JSON shape
  - Includes `storefronts`, `catalogEntries`, `prices`, `requirements`, and object-style `itemGrants`.

- `catalog-with-currency`:
  - Same as `catalog`
  - Also includes `CurrencyStorefront` from `catalogSettings`.

- `catalog-versioned`:
  - Writes multiple catalog files in one run (default: `v1.json`, `v2.json`, `v3.json`)
  - Useful for backends that switch shop files by client version/build.

### Single target example

```js
outputPath: "./output",
outputFile: "catalog_config.json",
outputProfile: "simple"
```

### Multi-target example (recommended)

Generate multiple backend formats in one run:

```js
outputTargets: [
  {
    profile: "simple",
    outputPath: "./output",
    outputFile: "catalog_config.json"
  },
  {
    profile: "simple-meta",
    outputPath: "./output",
    outputFile: "catalog_config_v2.json"
  },
  {
    profile: "catalog",
    outputPath: "./output",
    outputFile: "catalog.json"
  },
  {
    profile: "catalog-versioned",
    outputPath: "./output",
    versionedFiles: ["v1.json", "v2.json", "v3.json"]
  }
]
```

### Catalog storefront tuning

Use `catalogSettings` to tune catalog shape:

```js
catalogSettings: {
  refreshIntervalHrs: 24,
  dailyPurchaseHrs: 24,
  expiration: "9999-12-31T23:59:59.999Z",
  includeCurrencyStorefront: false,
  currencyStorefrontName: "CurrencyStorefront",
  dailyStorefrontName: "BRDailyStorefront",
  featuredStorefrontName: "BRWeeklyStorefront",
  currencyEntries: []
}
```

For versioned-catalog backends, keep `catalog-versioned` enabled and replace your backend's `v1/v2/v3` shop files with generated files.

### Important fixes in current version

- Output path bug fixed (it now writes to configured target files, not hardcoded paths).
- Chapter/season filters now parse values like `Chapter 2` and `Season 4` correctly.
- Daily and featured picks are now unique (no duplicate cosmetics across slots).
- Strict type filtering prevents invalid item templates by default.
